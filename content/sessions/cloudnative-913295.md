In this session, I will introduce some key features of Apache Kafka 4.0, including the next-generation consumer rebalance protocol (KIP-848), queues for Kafka (KIP-932), and more. I will then discuss how to smoothly upgrade from older Kafka versions to 4.0 and analyze the implications for client compatibility. Finally, I will share Huawei Cloudâ€™s explorations and practices in cloud-native based on Apache Kafka 4.0.
