      <description>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. It has a wide range of application scenarios in industry and plays an increasingly important role.
Three types of topics suitable for this sub forum are as follows:</description>

      <description>Microservices have become the default choice for our technology stack, and it seems that anything other than microservices is considered outdated. However, in the past two years, doubts about microservices have started to emerge, and people have begun to miss the simplicity and directness of monolithic services, avoiding the various governance costs that come with service-oriented architecture. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of new programming frameworks that provide developers with the experience and efficiency of monolithic development while retaining the flexibility, scalability, and even certain serverless characteristic</description>

      <description>Why an ApacheCon Performance Engineering Track? Because many Apache projects address domains with software performance and scalability challenges (E.g. Web, Cloud, Databases, Streaming Data, Big Data, Data Analytics, Search, Geospatial, etc), while others provide performance engineering tools (E.g. benchmarking, testing, monitoring, etc) that are widely used, so the track will provide opportunities for cross-fertilization between projects of different software categories and maturity.</description>
